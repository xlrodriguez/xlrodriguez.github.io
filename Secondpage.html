<p> <mark><b>Can we use the concept of Web 2.0 to imagine a web service that could be used to empower students and address educational inequity?  As a concept and a process of doing the web, I think web 2.0 and its infrastructure provide a really interesting case for how one could use technology and the internet to navigate between, circumvent, and co-opt power structures.  In particular I’m thinking of the power structures that control the United States education system.</b></mark></p>
<p><mark><b>In Tim O’reily’s article “What Is Web 2.0 Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software” he discusses at length the history and development of what we now refer to as Web 2.0.  In the process O’reily undertook to identify the defining principles and practices of Web 2.0 I was very interested in the principles of “trusting users as co-developers and harnessing collective intelligence”.  When imagining solutions to the issue of educational inequity and inadequacy I am a strong believer that students must be the ones who work together to address the challenges they find most onerous within their education system.  However, in order for students to successfully address these challenges they must feel empowered to do so and supported in their actions.</b></mark></p>
<p><mark><b>I think the principle of the web as a platform, that is so fundamental to the concept of Web 2.0, is a really viable way to empower students.  The power of the web to give people a voice and platform for your story to be heard is unmatched.  It was facebook and twitter that allowed people to circumvent the strict censorship laws put in place by dictatorships throughout the Arab world and empower people to fight for their rights during the Arab Spring.  The web is a extremely powerful platform, and I believe it can be used as one that could empower students across the world to circumvent the challenges imposed by government spending, inadequate/bias textbooks, and countless other challenges in education to harness their collective intelligence to create the future that they want for education.
</b></mark></p>
<p><mark><b>Realistically what I imagine this process looking like would be an open source web service that students would use similar to the way they use google maps or any social networking site.  I imagine that any user (most likely students) could get on to this shared map that all users have and they could map/write reviews on places they view as valuable educational resources within their communities or even within their schools.  The service would be similar to yelp but the focus would be on schools and education.  Students could also map places they see as detrimental to their education or write negative reviews.  I imagine it similar to the process of wikipedia harnessing collective intelligence in a free and trusting way.

<p><mark><b>When discussing Google, one of the most important Web 2.0 darlings, O’reily writes “Google happens in the space between browser and search engine and destination content server, as an enabler or middleman between the user and his or her online experience”.  This is one of the things that excites me most about technology/the web.  There are infinite possibilities to do things, anything that you can imagine.  There are so many work arounds, in betweens, and the deep web that I think with the right intention the internet can be used as a truly radical space.
