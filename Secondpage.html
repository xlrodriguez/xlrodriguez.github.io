<h2 style="text-align:left;"><mark><b>Web 2.0 and Empowering Students?</b></mark></h2>

<p><b>Can we use the concept of Web 2.0 to imagine a web service that could be used to empower students and address educational inequity?  As a concept and a process of doing the web, I think web 2.0 and its infrastructure provide a really interesting case for how one could use technology and the internet to navigate between, circumvent, and co-opt power structures.  In particular I'm thinking of the power structures that control the United States education system.</b></p>

<p><b>In Tim O'reily's article <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html">"What Is Web 2.0 Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software"</a> he discusses at length the history and development of what we now refer to as Web 2.0.  In the process O'reily undertook to identify the defining principles and practices of Web 2.0 I was very interested in the principles of "trusting users as co-developers and harnessing collective intelligence".  When imagining solutions to the issue of educational inequity and inadequacy I am a strong believer that students must be the ones who work together to address the challenges they find most onerous within their education system.  However, in order for students to successfully address these challenges they must feel empowered to do so and supported in their actions.</b></p>
<p><b>I think the principle of the web as a platform, that is so fundamental to the concept of Web 2.0, is a really viable way to empower students.  The power of the web to give people a voice and platform for your story to be heard is unmatched.  It was facebook and twitter that allowed people to circumvent the strict censorship laws put in place by dictatorships throughout the Arab world and empower people to fight for their rights during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IH7MQf7y2U">Arab Spring</a>.  The web is a extremely powerful platform, and I believe it can be used as one that could empower students across the world to circumvent the challenges imposed by government spending, inadequate/bias textbooks, and countless other challenges in education to harness their collective intelligence to create the future that they want for education.
</b></p>

<p><b>Realistically what I imagine this process looking like would be an open source web service that students would use similar to the way they use google maps or any social networking site.  I imagine that any user (most likely students) could get on to this shared map that all users have and they could map/write reviews on places they view as valuable educational resources within their communities or even within their schools.  The service would be similar to yelp but the focus would be on schools and education.  Students could also map places they see as detrimental to their education or write negative reviews.  I imagine it similar to the process of wikipedia harnessing collective intelligence in a free and trusting way.
</b></p>
<p><b>When discussing Google, one of the most important Web 2.0 darlings, O'reily writes "Google happens in the space between browser and search engine and destination content server, as an enabler or middleman between the user and his or her online experience".  This is one of the things that excites me most about technology/the web.  There are infinite possibilities to do things, anything that you can imagine.  There are so many work arounds, in betweens, and the deep web that I think with the right intention the internet can be used as a truly radical space.

<h2 style="text-align:left;"><mark><b>Personal Learning Environments and Easy Knowledge Access</b></mark></h2>

<p><b>I think my personal learning environment is a perfect example of how to use the internet and its services to work smarter not harder.  With the internet we have practically all the knowledge of the world readily available to us, and if it is not readily available to us it is most likely an email or two away.  If we think of our personal learning environment as a way to ease the process of accessing knowledge we can make our lives much more rich and simple at the same time.
</b></p>

<img src="ple.png" width="450" height="300" align="right"/>

<p><b>You might ask "how can one use their personal learning environment to make their life both more rich and simple"?  To answer this question I turn to my own personal learning environment.  Particularly I would like to focus on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajh_Q0fF0SU">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.slader.com/">Slader</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19138758/how-to-align-caption-underneath-image">stackoverflow</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figcaption.asp">W3Schools</a>.  These are probably my most used services out of all those included in my personal learning environment.  I have taught myself nearly 100% of all the content in my computer science classes through YouTube videos.  I use YouTube for everything I want to learn; from how to do my makeup and hair, to finding out the new fashion trends, to making vegan curry, to finding a review on the new product I want to buy, to learning how to fix the lock on my door I just broke, to understanding how to draw a circuit diagram, to watching documentaries and news stories.  When it comes to learning YouTube is always my first stop, particularly because I am a very auditory learner.  Therefore, YouTube allows me to not waste time or money on textbooks I wont read or understand when I can just watch free YouTube videos and learn everything I need to know.  This is especially doable for the field that I am in because literally everything you would need to know about computer science has already been published online.  If it has not yet been published you probably created something new.  stackoverflow and W3Schools are also two great examples of how I am able to easily make my knowledge of computers more rich by simply turning to these websites that have already published everything I would want to know.  Slader and Quizlet actually have the answers to almost all of my homework assignments and they often include explanations.</b></p>

<p><b>One of the most important benefits of my personal learning environment is the amount of time it saves me.  If I cannot immediately find the answer to something on one of the web services I mentioned previously my next plan of attack is to hit my social networking sites to see if someone I know has the knowledge I am looking for.  If it is for class I might message one of my classmates or someone I know who is in the same field as me.  One time a girl I have never met, but who I follow on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fbbezus/">instagram</a> posted a story of her struggling with a section of code and I messaged her my entire code for a similar project I had done.  Even if it is not an academic question I constantly post on my story for people who are looking to sell me music festival tickets.  I'm also constantly learning about fun social events happening or protests/demonstration/fundraisers for causes I am dedicated to from instagram.  All in all my personal learning environment just makes the facilitation of my knowledge consumption and production so much easier, which also increases the opportunities I have for knowledge consumption and production exponentially.

<h2 style="text-align:left;"><mark><b>Authenticity on the Internet</b></mark></h2>

<figure><img src="solange.png" width="450" align="left"> <figcaption style="text-align: left">"Solange Knowles' instagram profile" Instagram, Solange Knowles, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saintrecords/">https://www.instagram.com/saintrecords/ </a> </figcaption></figure>




<p><b>The person whose professional internet presence I admire most is Solange Knowles.  I am a huge fan of Solange Knowles and her artistry.  As a musician, visual artist, dancer, interior designer, and fashion icon I feel that Knowlesâ€™ art is constantly pushing forward and innovating.  However, what I love most about her art is that it is so personal.  While much of what she does with her art has never been done before: almost everything she does is heavily based on her life experiences and particularly her identity as a Black woman from the United States.  Though, much of her work is highly conceptual, the fact that her own self is so present and that she easily expresses vulnerability within her art makes her work seem more accessible than most other high concept and abstract dance/design.  This vulnerability and, ultimately, authenticity is what I love most about Knowles, and it is what I think makes her internet presence most successful.</b></p>

<p><b>I have been following Knowlesâ€™ <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saintrecords/">instagram <a/> for a good while now, and she is definitely the professional account I visit the most.  What I love about her account is that there is such a heavy contrast between the content I can find.  One post could be a super glamorous cover she shot for <a href="https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/3kgpw8/solange-knowles-interview-tim-walker"> iD</a> magazine, the next post could be a high concept set design and performance art piece filmed in the middle of a meadow, and then after that could be a mirror video she took of herself and her friend singing and smoking weed.  And while this may make it seem that her instagram would look disconnected that is not the case.  Knowles has such a unique style and aesthetic that is so clearly her that everything she posts flows beautifully.  She knows what she finds visually appealing and her art is so authentically her that she can express all the complexities of her identity and artistry online with it flowing seamlessly.</b></p>

<p><b>Beyond her instagram she has her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwLW3Cf-us5rBPSPeXnIm6Q">YouTube</a> channel linked in the bio of her instagram and she has her website <a href="https://saintheron.com/">saintheron.com</a>.  However, these projects are all very different, so it is hard to compare them.  The website is focused on her production and creative agency, so it holds information about events and upcoming artists she is working with.  Her YouTube channel is much more focused on her music and videography work.  Her instagram is where most of her personal content, fashion, and performance art work is published.  I think this is really smart of her, because she understands what type of content people want to see on what type of platforms.  And although she has a lot of different content her aesthetic, which makes up a large part of her brand, comes through strong on every platform.</b></p>
