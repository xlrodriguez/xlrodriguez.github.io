<p> <mark><b>I hope you have enjoyed my website. I am a big fan of the kitsch aesthetic.
In the past couple years kitsch has become a major aesthetic in design and fashion (in particular) which makes sense because its suppossed to appeal to popular culture.  I
figured there was no better way to showcase my style and web design capabilities than by making a cat website.  Hopefully if you are a possible
employer of mine you still view me as a serious candidate.  I love Computer Science and would be thrilled to have the time and opportunity to work on non cat related projects!</b></mark></p>
