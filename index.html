<p style=" color:#236B8E">My name is Xiomara Rodriguez.  I am currently a Junior at Occidental College.  My major is Computer Science with a focus in Education.  I am particularly interested in the capability technology and digital tools have to support and create radical change.
Another major interest of mine is the us of social media in the development of global networks of activist dedicated to radical/social change and decolonization.  My previous work has focused mainly on analyzing the ways digital tools such as apps and virtual reality simulators can support
radical change and network building. My next project is focused on using technology such as social networks and GIS mapping to address educational inequity and empower students to have a voice in their education and opportunities.</p>
